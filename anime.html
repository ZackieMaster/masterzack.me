    <h3><u><center>The Anime Journey</center></u></h3>
    <p>It all began in Fall 2019 when I just got recovered from my  life-threatening disease (name not to be disclosed). Sunday 6'O clock in the morning, when everyone in my family was asleep, I was awake and surfing through the internet on my Redmi 4X. Surfing the internet this early without even washing the face was like a daily habit of mine which I started doing when I was like 6 or 7. I'm glad that I don't do this kind of stuff now. </p>
    
    <p>So, that day when I was surfing through the internet, I found a website named Dead Toons India. I was happy to find it because I was looking for a site where I could watch an old TV show named Zatch Bell. After finding the site, what I did was, of course, watching Zatch Bell. Slowly and steadily, I watched all the 150 eps by the time we were stuck in COVID-19 Lockdown.</p>
    
    <p>On DTI, I also found the other OG tv stuff like Zinba, Infinity Nado, Redakai. I watched them all one by one. It was lockdown so I had plenty of time y'know. I watched some pokemon movies, some ben 10. DTI had plenty to offer and one of them was Anime. But that doesn't mean I started watching anime from there. Instead, I watched anime through CoolsAnime.</p>

    <p>Now, the thing is that I was a huge fan of this gaming YouTuber back then named BeastBoyShub (Guy had a real downfall). In one of his videos he talked about Demon Slayer, Goblin Slayer, Steins Gate, Death Note and everyone's favorite High School DxD. I thought, let's watch them all. I opened DTI and searched Demon Slayer first but I was disappointed. DTI only had Hindi Subtitles for it. Imagine reading hindi subtitles, how can anyone do that? </p>

    <p>I dropped the idea of watching them as I didn't know any other website where I could watch them and I wasn't on discord back then, so no one was there who could help me out. More like, I wasn't the type of guy who would ask for help from anyone. </p>

    <p>Months later, September 2020, a site named CoolsAnime just popped up on my browser. Yes, it just popped up out of nowhere. To be honest, I don't really remember how did I find it but it doesn't matter. I rushed through the site and downloaded Sword Art Online. I chose SAO because it was on the homepage. There was no other specific reason.  In its first ep, I was astonished by everything. Back then and still now, I'm a big Sci-Fi lover. Getting introduced to the Deep Dive VR technology was quite stunning. In the end of the first ep, we are told that everyone is now trapped in virtual reality and if they die, they will actually die. This plot was something I never found in any Hollywood Movie I had ever watched (Watching movies was a hobby of mine which is now currently replaced by watching web series and anime). Even back then, I had watched a lot of movies but this Japanese Cartoon was on a whole another level. Even the music, LiSA's voice was just too sweet. I completed the first season but then I dropped the second. We will talk about it sooner in this article, just wait a bit. </p>

    <p> So, SAO was dropped and I had to watch something now. It was still lockdown and I was with plenty of free time. I thought about watching the anime which I wanted to from the start. I opened CoolsAnime and searched Demon Slayer. I was happy to see that there was an entry about it there. Now, I'm going to say things which the Legendary Weebs (basically the lifeless shut-ins) would laugh on. The animation, music, concept, plot and everything was far above my expectations. I never thought that cartoon could be so good. I fuckin finished the first season and desperately waited for Infinity Train release. The release of this movie was also the reason I joined AUI and started using Discord. I didn't watch any other anime after Demon Slayer even though I finished the first season in October 2020. I just watched Star Wars and this old movie trilogy where a seductive alien kills people after having sex with them. I would have recommended it to you only if I could remember the name.</p>

    <p> As time passed, 2021 came. It was my golden year of anime. The combined amount of anime I watched in both 2022 and 2023 is just roughly equal to 2021. At first, things were going slow. It was a chilly new year and I was bored. I had dropped SAO at 2nd Season because the first 3eps were just too boring. However, when I start something, I finish it. Always. (i dont do this anymore btw, I now have plenty of experience leaving things unfinished). So, thinking I should really finish SAO, I gave it a second chance. This chance was worth it. Except the 2nd half of S2, it was good. And when I started S3, I became addicted to it. 7 hours, I watched SAO S3 for 7 hours straight. It was a thing I had never done in my entire life and I still never do. For the first time, I literally watched anime in hardcore mode. S3 was finished just like that. Now, it was time to watch another. </p>

    <p> There was another anime named Death Note in the list which BBS provided me in his video. As usual, I opened CoolsAnime and searched Death Note. However, there was a problem this time. Death Note wasn't available on CoolsAnime. Losing all hope, I thought to myself, "Let's stop watching anime". But special thanks to Elemento~Kun for introducing me to gogoanime. If he wasn't there to tell me this, the timeline would have been different. </p>

    <p> I watched Death Note, Steins Gate, Magi, Attack on Titan, Slime Reincarnation, Parasyte, Overlord, Re Zero, High School Dxd and a lot of other stuff. Watching anime back then was a little hard as I had limited data. Though, I have unlimited 5G now and archivist access. I watch only the best encodes now. The ones who are like 2GB per ep. </p>

    <p><u>Important thing: I watched Your Name long before Demon Slayer but I cannot remember when was it. I didn't watch it through DTI, it was share to me by a friend. Maybe it was after Zatch Bell or Zinba. Well, who cares. Because I certainly don't</u></p>
