		<h2><u>AI And Unemployment</center></u></h3>
<p>Hmph 😏 got your attention, didn't I? Dear Reader, I digitally express my grievance for you because you have have been successfully caught in a clickbait situation. AI and Unemployment, history's one of the biggest jokes I've ever heard. </p>

<p>Hold your horses, guys. Before we all run for the hills screaming, "The robots are coming! The robots are coming!", let's take a deep breath and examine this whole AI and unemployment thing with a pinch of salt and a bowl full of common sense. Let's see, what is AI. In the simplest of words, it's ArTIFiciAL iNTelliGEnCe, which for some reason doesn't actually have a bit of intelligence.</p>

<p>Currently, you and I are examining this situation with "common sense", but does AI have common sense? Nah nah nah, It doesn't have anything except a large set of mumbo jumbo dataset it has been trained with. And that's exactly why everytime you use Generative AI, you need to tell it exactly what you want. It's the same thing with machinery, it does more efficient job than us pesky little humans but did it kick the workers out of the factory as they expected? Nah, man. What it did was make their working conditions much better, their lives more easier, OUR LIVES more easier. It's so much easy these days that I don't need to print this article because you guys are already reading this RIGHT NOW</p>


<p>• Is AI progressing more faster than you doing your college assignments? Yes.</p>

<p>• Is AI better than us at writing boring lengthy speeches? Absolutely Yes.</p>

<p>• But can it solve a simple mathematical word problem which requires basic linear equations? Absolutely NO!</p>


<p>Have some coffee or tea or cold drink or alcohol(not recommended) and just chill for a bit. I used to solve those stupid linear equations for fun instead of doing gaming and other stuff. No one can tell me that a Text Generation Model who isn't able to do that can take away my job. 

<p>From image generators that can draw your waifu (badly, I might add) to algorithms that can predict stock markets (also badly, but don't tell the Wall Street bros), AI is making its presence felt in almost every industry. But here's the kicker – AI isn't here to steal your job; it's here to make your job better. Think of it as your very own digital sidekick, minus the cool catchphrases. Remember the good old saying, "Machines have made our lives easier"</p>

<p>It's just a machine bro, under the sparkly vibrant cover of ArTIFiciAL iNTelliGEnCe, it is just a machine ._.</p>

<p>When machines first started popping up in factories, people thought it was the end of the world as they knew it. "Oh no, the steam engine is going to leave us all jobless!" or so they cried. That's exactly what you guys are doing, stop with this nonsensical AI unemployment thing, be smart and use it for you own good. My own website masterzack.me has been half-made by GPT because Im so lazy to do the job myself (and it was a frustrating experience, trust me) </p>

<p>Now you guys would say, "What are you saying lil bro? First you told us to use AI for our own benefit and now you are saying that it was a frustrating experience. Get your points straight!!!"</p>

<p>Well, ok, let's get straight. I am unskilled. Yes, but unskilled for what? Unskilled for using AI of course. You heard it right my dear reader, using AI is a skill of another realm. When computers were made, people were also scared for their jobs, but what happened in reality was that multiple jobs for computer were invented. The job to use a computer, the job to build a computer, the job to design a computerized, the job to teach how you do it and blah blah blah. </p>

<p>You see, the Generative AI can't live without you and your prompts. Unless you tell it what to do, how to do other stuff, in long term it would just be a disappointment. And that's where you come in with your excretion skill of writing Prompts. Ever thought why there is always a boss above your head? (unless you are a rich dude). He is there to keep you in line. And that's exactly what your job would become after the mass adoption of Generative AI. You can't leave that thing on its own, it would be a disaster (im speaking from experience)</p>


<p>Yes, some jobs will change, and others might disappear altogether. But before you start planning your new career as a professional web series binger (still waiting for that job to become a thing), let's look at how AI is actually making our work lives better:</p>

<p>• Data entry, anyone? Well, AI is here to take those off your plate. Imagine a world where you never have to manually input another spreadsheet or sort through endless emails.</p>

<p>• The Rise of the Cyborg Workforce (Less scary than it sounds), write a few words of instructions and sit back, let our never-exhausting friend do the job</p>

<p>• AI ethicists, machine learning engineers, data scientists – these are all roles that didn't exist a few decades ago. And let's not forget the most important job of all: teaching AI not to take over the world. (You are not going to get past me Terminators!)</p>


<p>Now, I know what you're thinking. "But what about all those doom and gloom predictions? What about the studies that say AI will replace X% of jobs in Y years?" Well, my friends, let me introduce you to a little thing called the "crystal ball effect." You see, predicting the future is a tricky business. If it were easy, we'd all be billionaires living on Mars right now.</p>

<p>But now you would say "Hey, aren't you also predicting future when you are saying we would make AI do our job and still have a job?"<p>

<p>The truth is my dear reader, no one knows exactly how AI will impact the job market in the long run. But if history has taught us anything, it's that humans are incredibly adaptable. I'm sure you guys can tackle a few machines. How hard can it be? Just throw a mug of coffee at them and make them cry (umm they can't cry)</p>

<p>Speaking in serious terms, take my words with a close to zero attention and relax. It's not going to take your job today or tomorrow or next year. Highly functional robots are not going to be made just any time right now. You are too young to get worried. However if you are reading this article from 22nd Century, that would be a different case </p>

<p>In conclusion, the AI revolution isn't something to fear, it's something to prepare for and even look forward to. It's not about humans versus machines; it's about humans and machines working together to create a better, more efficient, and hopefully less boring work environment. (actually it's about us humans making machines do slavery) </p>

<p>Now you go chill, I go chill, C-YA-LATER~</p>
