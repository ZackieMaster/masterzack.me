<h4><u><center>OTT: Critique (HateSpeech)</center></u></h4>

<p> Honestly speaking, I seriously don't know the full form of OTT. What I do know is, that they are online platforms where you can enjoy your movies and shows, or at least that's what they are supposed to be.
In this hatespee-    I mean in this critique, I will be talking about my experience with the OTTs and I will tell you how shit they really are. </p>

<h5> Amazon Prime Video </h5>
<p> Imagine making an annual account on Amazon Prime just to find out that half of the library is on rent. Yup, On July 18th of 2024, that was exactly my experience. From Pokemon to Kung fu Panda, from The Karate Kid to Oppenheimer, everything I saw on prime was on rent. I thought to myself, "Then what's the prime subscription for?"
CDN$ 99 per year is for what then? Free shopping for low-pay orders? just that? The OTT didn't look usable to me. I mean, if you are paying that much money, shouldn't you get to watch what they have to provide instead of getting the chance to rent or buy?They only have a few titles to watch without rent, Am I supposed to watch just them for whole year again and again????
Completely Useless. I uninstalled amzn in like 2mins. </p>

<h5> Netflix </h5>
<p> As unfortunate as it may sound, I've had the unpleasant misfortune to use Netflix for 2 months. And seriously, it is even more of a dogshit than Spotify. What's with the certifications thing? Can't watch HDR on phone if your device doesn't have Netflix as pre-installed, stupid 3rd rate bloatware promotion move. Imagine having a 1080p Screen, a UHD plan, and only being able to watch in 720p because Netflix doesn't see you worthy enough to get an FHD certification (Widevine L1). It literally takes your money, doesn't provide you the benefits you are supposed to have, and it still shows you ads on some of its plans. Oh and by the way, the subtitles for anime on Netflix are shit, I regret watching Fate/Zero on it.
Truly Terrible Experience. </p>

<h5> Crunchyroll </h5>
 <p4> I will just call this one "Weeb Shit" and happily move on. </p4>

<h5> Disney+ Hotstar </h5>
<p4> Even the plot in a porn-shoot is more meaningful and remembering than the existence of Disney+ Hotstar. I don't see anything of worth on this platform except The Mandalorian and Moon Knight. It has me wondering and terrified about how much more far things can become worse. Having the worst level of lossy compression, it has been quite successful in making a 1080p video look like a 360p one. My eyes were destroyed the moment I thought of watching Moon Knight on it. The stream is already lossy and when you download from it, the video becomes lossy 10x (maybe even 50x)
Had the Marvel shitshow be a little better, I might've held it in a higher regard, but sadly we don't live in a perfect world. </p4>

<h5> Discovery+ </h5>
<p> Why? Seriously why? Why the seasons in-between half the shows aren't available? Did the tapes in your headquarters got burnt up or what? I wanted to watch Buddy vs Duff, S2 is unavailable. I wanted to watch Storage Wars, 3 seasons aren't available. And what happened to the Hindi dub of Forged in Fire, it's available on TV but not on OTT. The folks at Discovery+ are so incompetent that they can't even manage their own media. It feels like a half-hearted rip-off of Discovery Channel made with the sole purpose of being in touch with the mainstream. The + in your name doesn't make you any special, bitch. 
Bonus point: Shit UI </p>

<h5> Peacock TV </h5>
<p> I would agree that there are some really good must-watch sitcoms available on this platform such as Superstore and Brooklyn 99. But a 100 bucks for sitcoms? :(
Doesn't sound good to me. I believe there is a term called diversity and this platform definitely lacks in that area. It makes you feel like you are paying for a book but what you get is only a chapter. </p4>

<h5> Max (formerly HBO Max) </h5>
<p> It is quite laughable that how this platform is called "Max" but the library on it is bare "minimum". I honestly forgot about this one until it was brought up in a conversation few days ago. I would say that this and Disney+ Hotstar come from the same breed. Both of them are easily forgettable. </p4>

<h5> MUBI </h5>
<p> Haven't used this one myself so can't say much but when you ask on google about what shows to watch on MUBI, the first one which comes is called "How to have Sex". After asking about this one with other people, I came to know that the movie itself doesn't have any R-rated scenes. So I guess this platform is just a huge clickbait. </p>

<h5> Final Notes </h5>
<p> To reduce the cost of maintenance and to maximize the profit, these OTTs compress the files and present them in such a way that it literally makes me want to puke. Buying a BluRay is much better than paying for these streaming platforms. You can buy 10 OTTs, spend hundreds of dollars every month but you STILL won't even get 10% of the media available on this planet due to licensing and exclusives bullshit they've got.

Long Live Piracy </p>

<h5> Honorable Mentions <h5>
<p> Zee5, SonyLIV, Alt Balaji (don't even think about using them) </p>
